## Information

This application randomizes items in the La-Mulana script.dat file. Even after randomization, you can finish the game (but it may contain bugs...).

If you feel stuck, see some tips below. They may help.

----

## How to use

Place seed and La-Mulana install directory, select options, then push Apply.

### Hint

- By exploring the ground and *Gate of Guidance*, you can obtain the *Hand Scanner*, *Shell Horn*, *Holy Grail*, *Game Master*, and *Glyph Reader*. These are essential for comfortable game play.
- *Game Master 2* will be available by the time you need to defeat Guardians. This is because you can use a limited number of Ankh Jewels to defeat Guardians in the wrong order, which may result in a softlock.
- Be careful with a softlock. For example, going to *Dimensional Corridor* without *Bronze Mirror*.

### Stuck?

- The *Talisman*, *Diary*, and *Treasure* are still there even if they are overwritten by a different item on the inventory screen.
- The top right section of *Spring in the Sky* is accessible without the helmet. Use the *Feather* and *Grapple Claw* to get on the elevator.
- The bombable wall in *Graveyard of the Giants* can be opened from the left side if you have *Bombs* and enough health.
- Palenque's section of *Chamber of Extinction* can be accessed through the Gate of Time. Climb up the ladder and you get warped there.
- The door in *Tower of Ruin* leading to Viy can be accessed by using *Bombs* instead of *Spears*. Hold down to roll bombs.

## Constraints on the system

- Shop restrictions:
  - Maps are sold out if any map is acquired. Maps are not necessary to beat the game.
  - Sacred Orbs have the same problem as maps but have a real impact on game play.
  - Main Weapon cannot be displayed.
  - Shuriken, Throwing Knives, Flares, Spears, and Bombs are always ammo in shops.
  - Silver Shield and Angel Shield don't sell out when bought. You do get the proper item if purchased.
